    <p class="policy__text">
        We&nbsp;work hard to&nbsp;accommodate our clients to&nbsp;the best of&nbsp;our ability. All of&nbsp;our appointment confirmations are sent via text or&nbsp;email. Please honor your appointment.
    </p>
    <p class="policy__text">
        ALL No-Shows, Last Minute Cancellation, and Schedule Changes made within 6&nbsp;hours to&nbsp;your appointment time will incur a&nbsp;30% fee regardless of&nbsp;the reasons. Please do&nbsp;so&nbsp;at&nbsp;least six business hours before your appointment time to&nbsp;avoid these fees.&nbsp;10:00&nbsp;AM appointments must be&nbsp;canceled six business hours in&nbsp;advance by&nbsp;2:00&nbsp;PM the previous day, not 4:00&nbsp;AM on&nbsp;the day of&nbsp;the appointment. Please understand that we&nbsp;are appointment only and loss of&nbsp;one appointment has a&nbsp;big impact since technicians are tied to&nbsp;one customer at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time.
    </p>
    <p class="policy__text">
        The&nbsp;30% fee will vary from $15&nbsp;&mdash; $43, depending on&nbsp;the service you book.
    </p>
    <p class="poicy__text">Online cancellation is&nbsp;available for your convenience</p>
    <p class="policy__text">
        A&nbsp;credit card is&nbsp;required to&nbsp;hold all appointments. If&nbsp;you choose not to&nbsp;provide your credit card information, we&nbsp;will not be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;keep the appointment.
    </p>
    <p class="policy__text">
        IF&nbsp;YOU ARRIVE MORE THAN 15&nbsp;MIN LATE YOU WILL&nbsp;HAVE TO&nbsp;RESCHEDULE YOUR APPOINTMENT AND THERE WILL&nbsp;BE A&nbsp;$20&nbsp;FEE. THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR TIME IS&nbsp;IMPORTANT.
